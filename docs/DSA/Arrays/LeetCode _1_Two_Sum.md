### **Interview Simulation: LeetCode 1 - Two Sum**

---

**Interviewer**:  
Letâ€™s solve another common problem. Youâ€™re given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Return the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the `target`. Assume each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

**Candidate**:  
Let me confirm my understanding:  
- I need to find two numbers in the array whose sum equals the `target`.  
- I should return the indices of these two numbers, not the numbers themselves.  
- Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, so I donâ€™t need to handle cases with no solution or multiple solutions.  
Is that correct?  

**Interviewer**:  
Yes, thatâ€™s correct. How would you approach this?

---

### **Step 2: Brute Force Solution**

**Candidate**:  
To start with the simplest approach, I can use a nested loop:  
1. For each number in the array, Iâ€™ll iterate through the rest of the array to find a pair that sums to the `target`.  
2. When I find such a pair, Iâ€™ll return their indices.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):  # Loop through each element
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # Compare with elements after it
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:  # Check if they sum to target
                return [i, j]  # Return the indices
```

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity of this solution?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) because of the nested loops.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since weâ€™re not using any extra space.  

**Interviewer**:  
Good. Is there a more efficient way to solve this?

### **Step 3: Optimized Solution (HashMap)**

**Candidate**:  
Yes, I can optimize this using a HashMap:  
1. As I iterate through the array, Iâ€™ll calculate the complement for each number, which is `target - nums[i]`.  
2. Iâ€™ll check if the complement already exists in the HashMap.  
3. If it exists, Iâ€™ve found the pair, and Iâ€™ll return their indices.  
4. Otherwise, Iâ€™ll store the current number and its index in the HashMap for future lookups.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}  # Dictionary to store numbers and their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):  # Loop through the array
        complement = target - num  # Calculate the complement
        if complement in num_map:  # Check if complement is already in the dictionary
            return [num_map[complement], i]  # Return the indices
        num_map[num] = i  # Store the current number and its index in the dictionary
```

**Interviewer**:  
Great! Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity of this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we iterate through the array once, and dictionary lookups take O(1) on average.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store up to `n` elements in the dictionary.  

---

### **Step 4: Edge Cases**

**Interviewer**:  
What edge cases would you consider for this problem?  

**Candidate**:  
Here are some edge cases:  
1. **Negative numbers**: Ensure the solution works when `nums` contains negative numbers.  
   - Example: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4], target = -6` -> `True`.  
2. **Zero in the array**: The complement could be `0`.  
   - Example: `nums = [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0` -> `True`.  
3. **Large inputs**: Test the solution with a large array to ensure itâ€™s efficient.

### **Step 5: Explaining HashMap Logic**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you explain why the HashMap approach is more efficient than brute force?  

**Candidate**:  
Of course!  
- In the brute force solution, we compare every pair of elements, leading to O(nÂ²) time complexity.  
- The HashMap approach avoids unnecessary comparisons by using quick lookups:  
  - When iterating, we calculate the complement and immediately check if itâ€™s in the HashMap.  
  - This reduces the complexity to O(n), as we only traverse the array once and perform constant-time lookups.

### **Step 6: Alternative Approach (Sorting + Two Pointers)**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you solve this problem without using extra space?  

**Candidate**:  
Yes, I can use a sorting + two-pointer approach:  
1. Iâ€™ll sort the array, then use two pointersâ€”one at the beginning and one at the end.  
2. Iâ€™ll calculate the sum of the elements at the two pointers:  
   - If the sum is equal to `target`, return the indices.  
   - If the sum is less than `target`, move the left pointer to the right.  
   - If the sum is greater than `target`, move the right pointer to the left.  

However, sorting changes the order of the indices, so Iâ€™d need to track the original indices separately.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    nums_with_index = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]  # Pair numbers with indices
    nums_with_index.sort()  # Sort by numbers
    left, right = 0, len(nums_with_index) - 1

    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_with_index[left][0] + nums_with_index[right][0]  # Sum of two pointers
        if current_sum == target:
            return [nums_with_index[left][1], nums_with_index[right][1]]  # Return original indices
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right
        else:
            right -= 1  # Move right pointer to the left
```

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the complexity here?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the array with indices.

### **Step 7: Summary**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you summarize your approaches?  

**Candidate**:  
Sure!  
1. **Problem**: Find two indices in an array whose values sum to a given target.  
2. **Brute Force**: Use nested loops to check all pairs (O(nÂ²), O(1)).  
3. **Optimized**: Use a HashMap to store complements and indices (O(n), O(n)).  
4. **Alternative**: Sort the array and use two pointers (O(n log n), O(n)).  
5. **Edge Cases**: Negative numbers, zeros, large inputs.
