### **Interview Simulation: LeetCode 242 - Valid Anagram**

---

**Interviewer**:  
Letâ€™s move to another problem. Youâ€™re given two strings, `s` and `t`. Write a function to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once.  

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

**Candidate**:  
Let me confirm the requirements:  
- I need to check if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams.  
- Both strings must have the same characters with the same frequency, but the order doesnâ€™t matter.  
- For example:
  - `s = "listen", t = "silent"` -> `True` (valid anagram).
  - `s = "rat", t = "car"` -> `False` (not an anagram).  
Is that correct?

**Interviewer**:  
Yes, thatâ€™s correct. How would you solve this?  

---

### **Step 2: Brute Force Solution**

**Candidate**:  
The brute force approach involves:  
1. Sorting both strings.  
2. If the sorted versions of `s` and `t` are identical, theyâ€™re anagrams.  
3. Otherwise, theyâ€™re not.  

This works because sorting rearranges the characters in order, so two anagrams will have the same sorted representation.

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def isAnagram(s, t):
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)  # Compare sorted versions of both strings
```

**Interviewer**:  
Great. Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity of this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the strings, because sorting takes O(n log n).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as sorting creates new copies of the strings.  

**Interviewer**:  
Good. Can you optimize this?  

---

### **Step 3: Optimized Solution (Frequency Count)**

**Candidate**:  
Yes! I can optimize this using character frequency counts:  
1. Iâ€™ll create two dictionaries (or lists) to count the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`.  
2. If the frequency counts match, the strings are anagrams. Otherwise, theyâ€™re not.  
3. This avoids sorting and reduces time complexity.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def isAnagram(s, t):
    if len(s) != len(t):  # If lengths are different, they can't be anagrams
        return False
    
    count_s = {}  # Dictionary to store character frequencies of s
    count_t = {}  # Dictionary to store character frequencies of t

    for char in s:  # Count characters in s
        count_s[char] = count_s.get(char, 0) + 1

    for char in t:  # Count characters in t
        count_t[char] = count_t.get(char, 0) + 1

    return count_s == count_t  # Compare the frequency counts
```

**Interviewer**:  
Nice! Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity here?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings. Counting characters in both strings takes linear time.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we assume only 26 lowercase English letters, as the dictionaries have a fixed size. Otherwise, O(n) for general cases with arbitrary characters.

### **Step 4: Edge Cases**

**Interviewer**:  
What edge cases would you consider?  

**Candidate**:  
1. **Different lengths**: Strings with different lengths canâ€™t be anagrams.  
   - Example: `s = "abc", t = "abcd"` -> `False`.  
2. **Empty strings**: Two empty strings are valid anagrams.  
   - Example: `s = "", t = ""` -> `True`.  
3. **Case sensitivity**: Anagrams are typically case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.  
   - Example: `s = "aBc", t = "cab"` -> `False` (different cases).  
4. **Special characters or numbers**: If strings contain non-alphabetic characters, the logic still holds.  
   - Example: `s = "123", t = "321"` -> `True`.  

---

### **Step 5: Alternative Optimized Approach (Single Dictionary)**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you optimize further by reducing the use of two dictionaries?  

**Candidate**:  
Sure! Instead of two dictionaries, I can use a single dictionary:  
1. Increment counts for characters in `s`.  
2. Decrement counts for characters in `t`.  
3. At the end, if all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def isAnagram(s, t):
    if len(s) != len(t):  # If lengths differ, not an anagram
        return False

    count = {}  # Single dictionary for character counts

    for char in s:  # Increment counts for characters in s
        count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1

    for char in t:  # Decrement counts for characters in t
        if char not in count:  # If character in t is not in s
            return False
        count[char] -= 1
        if count[char] == 0:  # Remove the key when count becomes zero
            del count[char]

    return len(count) == 0  # Check if all counts are zero
```

**Interviewer**:  
Thatâ€™s clever! Whatâ€™s the complexity of this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we iterate through both strings once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for 26 lowercase English letters, or O(n) for general characters.

### **Step 6: Summary**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you summarize your approaches?  

**Candidate**:  
Of course!  
1. **Problem**: Check if two strings are anagrams.  
2. **Brute Force**: Sort and compare the strings.  
   - Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n).  
3. **Optimized (Frequency Count)**: Use two dictionaries to count characters.  
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(n).  
4. **Alternative (Single Dictionary)**: Use one dictionary to track counts.  
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) for limited character sets.  
5. **Edge Cases**: Different lengths, empty strings, case sensitivity, special characters.
