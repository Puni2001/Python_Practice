### **Interview Simulation: LeetCode 217 - Contains Duplicate**  

**Interviewer**:  
Let’s solve a simple problem to start. You’re given an integer array `nums`. You need to determine if the array contains any duplicate elements. If any value appears at least twice, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`. How would you approach this?  

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**  

**Candidate**:  
Alright, let me make sure I understand the problem.  
- I’m given an array of integers, and I need to check if there’s at least one repeated value.  
- If I find a duplicate, I return `True`. If all elements are unique, I return `False`.  
Does that sound correct?  

**Interviewer**:  
That’s exactly right! Let’s discuss your approach.

---

### **Step 2: Brute Force Solution**  

**Candidate**:  
To start, I’d go with the brute force approach:  
- I can compare every element in the array with every other element using two nested loops.  
- If I find two elements that are the same, I’ll return `True`. Otherwise, I’ll return `False` after checking all pairs.  

Would you like me to write the code for this?  

**Interviewer**:  
Yes, go ahead.  

**Candidate**:  
Here’s the brute force solution:  

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):  # Loop through each element
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # Compare it with the elements ahead
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:  # If duplicate found
                return True
    return False  # No duplicates found
```

**Interviewer**:  
Good. Can you analyze the time and space complexity of this solution?  

**Candidate**:  
Sure!  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) because we’re using two nested loops to compare all pairs of elements.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we’re not using any extra data structures.  

**Interviewer**:  
That’s correct. Do you think this approach is efficient for large inputs?  

**Candidate**:  
Not really. It’s fine for small arrays, but as `n` grows, the O(n²) time complexity becomes too slow. I’d optimize it using a more efficient approach.  

---

### **Step 3: Optimized Solution (HashSet)**  

**Interviewer**:  
Great! Tell me how you’d optimize this.  

**Candidate**:  
I’d use a HashSet to store elements as I iterate through the array:  
- I’ll check if the current number already exists in the set:  
  - If it does, I return `True`.  
  - If not, I add it to the set and continue.  
- This way, I only need a single loop, and checking membership in a set is O(1) on average.  

Here’s the code for this approach:  

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()  # Create an empty set to track seen elements
    for num in nums:  # Loop through the array
        if num in seen:  # If the number is already in the set
            return True  # Duplicate found
        seen.add(num)  # Otherwise, add the number to the set
    return False  # No duplicates found
```

**Interviewer**:  
Nicely done! What’s the time and space complexity of this solution?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because I traverse the array once, and each set operation (check or add) takes O(1) on average.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), because in the worst case, if all elements are unique, I’ll store all `n` elements in the set.  

**Interviewer**:  
Good answer. Can you think of a way to solve this without using extra space?  

---

### **Step 4: Alternative Solution (Sorting)**  

**Candidate**:  
Yes, I can avoid extra space by sorting the array first:  
- If there are duplicates, they will appear as consecutive elements in the sorted array.  
- After sorting, I’ll iterate through the array and compare each element with the next one.  
- If I find a pair that’s equal, I return `True`. Otherwise, I return `False` after completing the loop.  

Here’s the code for this approach:  

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # Compare adjacent elements
        if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:  # If duplicate found
            return True
    return False  # No duplicates found
```

**Interviewer**:  
Great! What’s the complexity for this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if the sorting is done in-place.  

**Interviewer**:  
Perfect! Let’s move to edge cases.

---

### **Step 5: Edge Cases**  

**Interviewer**:  
What edge cases would you test for this problem?  

**Candidate**:  
Here are some edge cases I’d consider:  
1. **Empty array (`[]`)**: Should return `False` since there are no elements.  
2. **Single-element array (`[1]`)**: Should return `False`, as duplicates are impossible.  
3. **Array with all unique elements (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`)**: Should return `False`.  
4. **Array with multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`)**: Should return `True`.  
5. **Negative numbers (`[-1, -2, -1]`)**: Should handle duplicates with negatives as well.

### **Step 6: Summary**  

**Interviewer**:  
Can you summarize everything we discussed for this problem?  

**Candidate**:  
Sure!  
1. **Problem**: Determine if an array contains duplicates.  
2. **Brute Force**: Compare all pairs using nested loops (O(n²), O(1)).  
3. **Optimized**: Use a HashSet to track seen elements (O(n), O(n)).  
4. **Alternative**: Sort the array and check consecutive elements (O(n log n), O(1)).  
5. **Edge Cases**: Empty array, single-element array, all unique elements, multiple duplicates, negative numbers.
