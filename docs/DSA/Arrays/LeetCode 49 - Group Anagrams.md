### **Interview Simulation: LeetCode 49 - Group Anagrams (with Explanations)**

---

**Interviewer**:  
Letâ€™s solve another string problem. Youâ€™re given an array of strings, `strs`, and you need to group the strings that are anagrams of each other.  

Can you explain your thought process and write the solution step by step while explaining it to me?  

---

### **Step 1: Problem Understanding**

**Candidate**:  
Sure! Let me break it down:  
1. I have an array of strings, `strs`.  
2. I need to group strings that are anagrams into separate lists.  
3. An anagram means the same characters rearranged, like "bat" and "tab".  

For example:  
Input: `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`  
Output: `[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]`  

Is my understanding correct?  

**Interviewer**:  
Yes, thatâ€™s correct. How would you approach this?  

---

### **Step 2: Brute Force Solution**

**Candidate**:  
Iâ€™ll start with a brute force solution:  
1. Compare each string with every other string to check if they are anagrams.  
2. To check if two strings are anagrams, I can sort their characters and compare the sorted strings.  
3. Iâ€™ll maintain a list of groups and keep adding strings to the appropriate group.  

Let me code this:  

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    # Initialize a list to store groups of anagrams
    groups = []  
    # Create a 'visited' array to track which strings are already grouped
    visited = [False] * len(strs)  

    # Outer loop to pick each string
    for i in range(len(strs)):
        if not visited[i]:  # If the string is not yet grouped
            group = [strs[i]]  # Start a new group
            visited[i] = True  # Mark the string as visited
            # Inner loop to compare with other strings
            for j in range(i + 1, len(strs)):  
                if sorted(strs[i]) == sorted(strs[j]):  # Check if anagrams
                    group.append(strs[j])  # Add to the group
                    visited[j] = True  # Mark as visited
            # Add the group to the result
            groups.append(group)  
    return groups
```

**Candidate**:  
This code uses two loops to compare each string with every other string. The key operation is sorting the strings to check if they are anagrams.  

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the complexity of this solution?  

**Candidate**:  
- Sorting each string takes O(k log k), where `k` is the length of the string.  
- Comparing all pairs means O(nÂ²) iterations.  
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(nÂ² * k log k)**.  

---

### **Step 3: Optimized Solution (Using HashMap)**

**Candidate**:  
The brute force approach is inefficient for large inputs. I can optimize this using a **HashMap**:  
1. Instead of comparing each pair, Iâ€™ll generate a "signature" for each string that represents its anagram group.  
2. Iâ€™ll use the **sorted version of the string** as the signature because all anagrams will have the same sorted form.  
3. Iâ€™ll store all strings with the same signature in a dictionary.  

Letâ€™s code this:  

---

#### **Optimized Code with Explanation**

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    # Initialize a dictionary to group anagrams
    anagram_map = {}  
    
    # Iterate through each string in the input list
    for string in strs:  
        # Step 1: Sort the string to create a unique signature for anagrams
        signature = ''.join(sorted(string))  
        # Step 2: Check if this signature is already in the dictionary
        if signature not in anagram_map:  
            anagram_map[signature] = []  # Initialize a new group if not found
        # Step 3: Add the string to the corresponding group
        anagram_map[signature].append(string)  
    
    # Step 4: Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists
    return list(anagram_map.values())  
```

---

**Candidate**:  
Hereâ€™s how the code works:  
1. For each string, I create a "signature" by sorting its characters.  
   - Example: "eat" becomes "aet", "tea" becomes "aet".  
2. I use this signature as the key in a dictionary.  
3. All strings with the same signature are added to the same list in the dictionary.  
4. Finally, I return all the values in the dictionary.  

---

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the complexity now?  

**Candidate**:  
- Sorting each string takes O(k log k). For `n` strings, itâ€™s O(n * k log k).  
- Adding to the dictionary is O(1) per string, so overall complexity is **O(n * k log k)**.  
- Space complexity is **O(n * k)** for the dictionary.  

---

### **Step 4: Further Optimization (Counting Signature)**

**Interviewer**:  
Can we avoid sorting the strings?  

**Candidate**:  
Yes. Instead of sorting, I can use a **character count array** as the signature:  
1. Iâ€™ll count the frequency of each letter in the string using a list of size 26.  
2. This count array represents the string uniquely, and itâ€™s faster than sorting.  
3. Iâ€™ll use the count array (converted to a tuple) as the key in the dictionary.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

---

#### **Counting Signature Code with Explanation**

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    # Initialize a dictionary to group anagrams
    anagram_map = {}  
    
    # Iterate through each string in the input list
    for string in strs:  
        # Step 1: Create a frequency count for each letter
        count = [0] * 26  # Array for 'a' to 'z'
        for char in string:  
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1  # Update frequency based on ASCII
        
        # Step 2: Convert the count array to a tuple (hashable) for use as a key
        signature = tuple(count)  
        
        # Step 3: Add the string to the corresponding group in the dictionary
        if signature not in anagram_map:  
            anagram_map[signature] = []  # Initialize a new group if not found
        anagram_map[signature].append(string)  
    
    # Step 4: Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists
    return list(anagram_map.values())  
```

### **Step 5: Edge Cases**

**Interviewer**:  
What edge cases would you test?  

**Candidate**:  
1. **Empty input**: `[]` -> Output: `[]`.  
2. **Single string**: `["a"]` -> Output: `[["a"]]`.  
3. **All identical strings**: `["aaa", "aaa"]` -> Output: `[["aaa", "aaa"]]`.  
4. **No anagrams**: `["cat", "dog"]` -> Output: `[["cat"], ["dog"]]`.  

---

### **Summary**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you summarize the approaches?  

**Candidate**:  
1. **Brute Force**: Compare all pairs, use sorting to check for anagrams.  
   - Complexity: O(nÂ² * k log k).  
2. **Optimized (Sorted Signature)**: Use sorted strings as keys in a dictionary.  
   - Complexity: O(n * k log k).  
3. **Counting Signature**: Use character counts as keys to avoid sorting.  
   - Complexity: O(n * k).
