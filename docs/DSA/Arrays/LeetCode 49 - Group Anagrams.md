### **Interview Simulation: LeetCode 49 - Group Anagrams**

---

**Interviewer**:  
Letâ€™s move to a string-based problem. Youâ€™re given an array of strings, `strs`, and you need to group the strings that are anagrams of each other.  

An anagram means the strings can be rearranged to form the same string. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams.  

Can you explain how you would solve this problem?  

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

**Candidate**:  
Let me confirm my understanding:  
1. I have an array of strings, `strs`.  
2. I need to group all strings that are anagrams of each other into separate groups.  
3. The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings that are anagrams.  

Is that correct?  

**Interviewer**:  
Yes, thatâ€™s correct. Can you provide a brute force solution first?  

---

### **Step 2: Brute Force Solution**

**Candidate**:  
For a brute force approach:  
1. I can compare each string with every other string to check if they are anagrams.  
2. To check if two strings are anagrams, I can sort their characters and compare the sorted strings.  
3. Iâ€™ll keep a list of groups and add strings to the appropriate group if they match.  

Hereâ€™s the code for the brute force approach:  

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    groups = []  # List to hold groups of anagrams
    visited = [False] * len(strs)  # Track if a string is already grouped

    for i in range(len(strs)):
        if not visited[i]:  # If the string is not yet grouped
            group = [strs[i]]  # Start a new group
            visited[i] = True  # Mark it as visited
            for j in range(i + 1, len(strs)):  # Compare with other strings
                if sorted(strs[i]) == sorted(strs[j]):  # Check if anagrams
                    group.append(strs[j])  # Add to the group
                    visited[j] = True  # Mark as visited
            groups.append(group)  # Add the group to the result
    return groups
```

---

**Interviewer**:  
Good. Whatâ€™s the complexity of this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting each string takes O(k log k), where `k` is the length of the string. If there are `n` strings, and we compare each pair, the complexity becomes O(nÂ² * k log k).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k), where `n` is for the `visited` array and `k` is for the sorted strings used in comparisons.  

---

### **Step 3: Optimized Solution**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you optimize this?  

**Candidate**:  
Yes. Instead of comparing each pair, I can use a **HashMap**:  
1. For each string, Iâ€™ll generate a "signature" that represents its anagram group.  
2. A simple signature is the sorted version of the string.  
3. Iâ€™ll use the signature as a key in a dictionary, and store all strings with the same signature in the same group.  
4. At the end, Iâ€™ll return the grouped values of the dictionary.  

Hereâ€™s the optimized code:  

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = {}  # Dictionary to group anagrams
    for string in strs:
        signature = ''.join(sorted(string))  # Use sorted string as the key
        if signature not in anagram_map:
            anagram_map[signature] = []  # Initialize a new group
        anagram_map[signature].append(string)  # Add string to the group
    return list(anagram_map.values())  # Return the grouped anagrams
```

---

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the complexity of this approach?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Sorting each string takes O(k log k), where `k` is the string length.  
  - With `n` strings, the total is O(n * k log k).  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - The dictionary can store up to `n` keys and `n` strings, so O(n * k).  

---

### **Step 4: Further Optimization (Counting Signature)**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you avoid sorting the string?  

**Candidate**:  
Yes, I can use a **character count array** as the signature:  
1. Instead of sorting, I count the frequency of each letter in the string using a list of size 26 (one for each letter).  
2. I use this list as a signature.  
3. This approach avoids sorting and reduces the time complexity.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = {}  # Dictionary to group anagrams
    for string in strs:
        count = [0] * 26  # Create a count array for 26 letters
        for char in string:
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1  # Update frequency of each letter
        signature = tuple(count)  # Convert count array to a tuple for hashing
        if signature not in anagram_map:
            anagram_map[signature] = []  # Initialize a new group
        anagram_map[signature].append(string)  # Add string to the group
    return list(anagram_map.values())  # Return the grouped anagrams
```

---

**Interviewer**:  
Whatâ€™s the complexity now?  

**Candidate**:  
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Counting characters takes O(k), where `k` is the string length.  
  - With `n` strings, the total is O(n * k).  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - The dictionary uses O(n * k) for storing signatures and strings.  

---

### **Step 5: Edge Cases**

**Interviewer**:  
What edge cases would you test for?  

**Candidate**:  
1. **Empty input**: Ensure it handles an empty list.  
   - Input: `[]` -> Output: `[]`.  
2. **Single string**: Should return the string as a group.  
   - Input: `["a"]` -> Output: `[["a"]]`.  
3. **All identical strings**: All strings should be in one group.  
   - Input: `["aaa", "aaa", "aaa"]` -> Output: `[["aaa", "aaa", "aaa"]]`.  
4. **No anagrams**: Each string should form its own group.  
   - Input: `["cat", "dog", "bird"]` -> Output: `[["cat"], ["dog"], ["bird"]]`.  

---

### **Step 6: Summary**

**Interviewer**:  
Can you summarize your approaches?  

**Candidate**:  
Sure!  
1. **Problem**: Group strings that are anagrams into separate groups.  
2. **Brute Force**: Compare each pair using sorted strings (O(nÂ² * k log k), O(n)).  
3. **Optimized**: Use sorted strings as HashMap keys (O(n * k log k), O(n * k)).  
4. **Counting Signature**: Use character counts as HashMap keys (O(n * k), O(n * k)).  
5. **Edge Cases**: Empty input, single string, all identical strings, no anagrams.
